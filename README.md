# DataViz-BankingFinanceDashboard

I have always been a fan of feature-rich yet clean dashboard like the Income Statement created by Andy Kriebel. So it all started with the idea to replicate the same dashboard to learn how he created it.

The dataset was DBS Group Holdings Ltd Annual Report 2019 that I downloaded from their website in PDF format. If you are interested in exploring the data, this depository contains the following items. 
- Python script to extract the 5-year summary table 
- The extracted datasets
- Tableau workbook for data visualisation

The final dashboard can be viewed at https://public.tableau.com/views/DBSFinancialSnapshot2019/Dashboard1?:language=en&:display_count=y&:origin=viz_share_link
